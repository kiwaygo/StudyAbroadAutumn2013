After I graduated from National Taiwan University in June, 2012, I spent a month archiving all the data, figures I produced at Theoretical Chemistry Lab as well as Communications and Multimedia Lab. I also wrote several reports, to explain in detail the experiements I conducted and the programs I wrote. Then, I began my mandatory military service, as Taiwanese government forbids citizens above 18 who have not finished their service to stay in foreign countries for over a defined duration. My time of service spans from August, 2012 to July, 2013. For the purpose of idling as less as possible, I carefully organize my schedule within short holidays during my service to apply for graduate schools in the U.S., and plan to start pursuing a graduate degree abroad in computer science in fall, 2013.
