I am aspired to a career as an artist more than a scientist.

From the viewpoint of not only appreciation, but creation, forms of digital art --- graphics, animation and music --- have long fascinated me with their high expressibility and power in storytelling since my childhood. As a kid who gained much sense of achievement by exhibiting his works to friends, I partcipated in virtually every extracurricular projects of designing class website, obtaining early experiences in digital image editing and photography. Later, amazed at the features produced by animation studios like Pixar and Dreamworks, I took a step further to self-study the creation of three-dimensional computer graphics(3DCG) using commercial software packages, and led a team to design and offer an introductory course about it at the information club of Taipei Municiple Chien-Kuo Senior High School.
