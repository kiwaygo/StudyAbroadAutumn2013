For many years, I have built up a keen desire in expressing myself through digital art --- computer graphics, animation and music --- whose capability and expressibility fascinated me and satisfied my aspiration to create. I have designed numerous websites and graphic layouts, taught myself 3D computer graphics (3DCG), and played with midi keyboards and audio editing softwares. As I graduated from one task to another, I realized that, although computers are powerful tools for rendering complicated effects and art styles through simulation, it remains difficult for artists to translate their intentions into languages which computers recognize. Thus, I intend to pursue a graduate degree in computer science to narrow the gap between technology and digital artists so that they can effectively unleash full power of computation on artistic purposes.

%Passion for digital art, especially 3DCG, has ignited my motivation to dive into a series of advanced courses in university curriculum, which equipped me with profound understanding in image synthesis, image processing, digital visual effects, computational photography and real-time rendering. I worked diligently, particularly in projects, where I often led others to hunt for inspiring papers and brainstorm ideas to redesign algorithms for specific goals. Teammates have praised my contributions in proposing prominent topics (i.e.\ ``Milktea Rendering''), planning feasible roadmaps and providing encouraging visions. Apart from curricular works, friends and I took months to survey and write a ray tracer in sophomore year. The excitement for opening the blackbox of 3DCG for the first time was unforgettable. I grasped the opportunities provided by these projects and courses to strengthen my capabilities in collaborative software development and to explore mechanisms behind functionalities of many tools I once used. My specialized knowledge in digital art has differentiated me from other students.

Passion for digital art, especially 3DCG, has motivated me to take advanced courses in image synthesis, image processing, digital visual effects, computational photography and real-time rendering. I led many course projects designing systems for art production ranging from a particle effect generator to a musical chord arranger. Notably, friends and I took months to survey and write a ray tracer accelerated with streaming SIMD extension in our sophomore year. It was my first encounter to what is inside the blackbox of 3DCG, and the excitement was unforgettable. These collaborative software projects provided me in-depth understanding of the technical basis of many art tools I once used. Such hands-on experience with digital art uniquely qualifies me for the Computer Science MS Program in ``Real-World Computing''.

% The lighting-by-guide project

I am most proud of my contribution to the development of ``Lighting-By-Guide System''. As an undergraduate student of Communications and Multimedia Lab, I was granted complete control of the project under supervision of Professor~Yung-Yu~Chuang in 2011, since when I have fostered essential traits for an independent researcher in computer graphics. I learned to discover bottlenecks through benchmarking and examining intermediate products, ask crucial questions which lead to significant improvements, and widely consult resources from journals to manuals. I managed the project through all engineering phases in the development of the ``Lighting-By-Guide'' algorithm to predict the quantity, positions, and properties of lights in a 3D scene from an artistic depiction of the anticipated render, namely the lighting-guide. The system largely reduces workloads of lighting artists by offering them lighting configurations that closely resmemble concept illustrations. My proposed ``most-noticeable-light-first'' optimization target succesfully achieves fast convergence and low perceptual difference between lighting-guides and images rendered with the predicted sets of lights.
 
% EC2D project:

My proficiency in researching stemed from not only abundant engineering experiences, but the concrete scientific trainings I recieved. Since 2008, I double-majored in chemistry and computer science. As a natural science, the study of chemistry places great emphasis in thinking critically and accurately, which complements my training in engineering that lays stress on innovation and systematic analysis. I was invited to join Theoretical Chemsitry Lab led by Professor~Yuan-Chung~Cheng. We verified novel designs of nonlinear electronic spectroscopy by simulating quantum dynamics of molecules interacting with laser pulses. Through formulating and implementing physically accurate models on computers, I acquired first-hand experiences working with various numerical algorithms and visualization packages. Moreover, the environment has cultivated my down-to-earth attitude toward solving issues whose wherefores are not understood. To me, revealing causes and effects of phenomena is far more urgent than getting codes to run. These skill sets and cogitation of a scientist are transferable and has contributed much to my success with the ``Lighting-By-Guide'' project. 

% All is not possible if it were not for a turning point in my freshman year. As I originally enrolled in university to study chemistry, a compromise for not doing well enough on the college entrance exam,  

% Aspiration: artist career. To tell great stories. To convey my love toward great things in life. Yet, ...

My ultimate goal is to leverage both my scientific and engineering background as well as my strong desire in creating digital artworks to establish an animation studio in my homeland, Taiwan, producing movies and developing intuitive tool sets for digital animators. However, since currently existed production pipelines for animated films are designed mainly for highly commercialized studios, they hardly suit the need for individual animators and the low capital-intensive environment in Taiwan. A solution is to revolutionize the ways artists can convey their intentions to computers so that detailed division of labor becomes unnecessary. While mere passion is not enough to grant the fulfillment of this goal, I need to recieve further trainings in doing research and to master the field of computer graphics.

The ``Real-World Computing'' specialization of the Computer Science MS Program at Stanford, with full access to graphic courses as well as sister disciplines, offers the challenges and oppurtunities I seek. This include the opportunity to work with faculties such as Professor~Ron~Fedkiw of the level-set method in graphical simulations, Professor~Vladlen~Koltun whose work greatly simplified 3D content creation, and Professor~Pat~Hanrahan whose contribution to rendering subsurface scattering effects sets the industrial standard. The challenge of working alongside the best and brightest student body will also be invaluable. One of my undergraduage projects, ``Milktea Rendering'', was inspired by several amazing works from the rendering competitions of the course ``Image Synthesis Techniques'' in 2008 and 2009. Hence, I full-heartedly anticipate in studying computer science at Stanford. With the guidance from your faculty, my diverse experiences and dedication to excel, I am confidnet in extending the frontiers of computer graphics as well as commencing my career as an industrial researcher in computer animation with a promising start.

% Due to my educational background and a strong desire to create, I aspire to become an artist who invents like an engineer and ponders like a scientist. Despite my early interest in digital art, I had a hobby of excerpting inspirations in life and developing them into novels, playscripts, and even musicals. My ultimate resolution is to establish an animation studio in my homeland, Taiwan, producing movies and developing expressive tools for digital animators. While lack of funding and human resources severely hinder our traditional animation industry from blooming, the prosperous status of our information/technology industry sets a more concrete foundation for producing computer animation. However, since currently existed production pipelines are designed mainly for highly commercialized studios, they hardly suit the need for individual animators and our low capital-intensive environment. A solution is to revolutionize the ways artists can convey their intentions to computers so that detailed division of labor becomes unnecessary. Evidently, mere passion is not enough to grant the fulfillment of this goal. I need to recieve further trainings in doing research and to master the field of computer graphics, which is the reason I apply for MS program in computer science at Stanford University.

%A scientist digests observations into theories, while an engineer employs theories to invent. My personal aspiration is to combine the both and become an artist, who invents from observations. Indeed, I was enthusiastic in collecting preliminary ideas and developing them into novels or playscripts. In 2012, I voluntarily directed the graduate musical for department of chemistry, where I led a team to work up everything from scratch with much sense of achievement. My fond of storytelling resulted in my ultimate resolution to establish an animation studio in my homeland, Taiwan, producing movies and developing novel tools for digital animators.
