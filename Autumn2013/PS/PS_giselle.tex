I was a lucky girl who had a science museum as her playground. My family lived near the National Museum of Natural Science. I visited the museum almost every week when I was little. I took notes on every visit, recording new and interesting discoveries in the exhibitions. I will never forget how excited I was when I first learned about the evolution of birds from dinosaurs, the Fibonacci series in biological patterns, and the total reflection shown by a green laser in the water flow. These experiences gave me a lasting wonder of the natural world. Additionally, the best part of learning science in a museum was doing experiments by myself. This gave me concrete knowledge and also inspired my interest in experimental research, which is why I decided to major in chemistry.\\
 
\vspace*{-1.2ex} 
Another of my early interests was art design. I earned awards in numerous art competitions before entering college. Now, this experience assists greatly in my academic and extracurricular work. The patience and care I learned from making complicated art help me in accomplishing many tasks, especially in lab work.  Additionally, I have led many group art productions including a department exhibition in the Azalea Festival and school drama set designs. Leading group art productions differs from individual projects. Group productions require skills to integrate various styles and encourage people to bring in new ideas. I learned how to give concrete and simple directions to help team members to accomplish the goal. Moreover, I realized that great success comes from a diverse team. And I am confident that I can lead such a team to success.\\

\vspace*{-1.2ex} 
Besides chemistry, I am also passionate about animals. Their amazing behavior represents a masterpiece of nature. I was a volunteer in the Taipei Zoological Foundation. Besides designing games that educate children about animal conservation, I joined in academic discussions that I found intriguing myself. I am curious to know if there is more to animal behavior than ecological explanations alone.  For example, I want to know what decides the 17 and 13 year life cycles of periodical cicadas in addition to the two coprime numbers being the result of avoiding each other's breeding year. The answers to these questions lie in a microscopic rather than a macroscopic scale. With my chemistry background, I believe I can make a unique contribution in such animal behavior studies.\\

\vspace*{-1.2ex} 
I have been fascinated by the delicate designs in biological systems.  Having a career that uncovers the mysteries in nature will be the fulfillment of my life's dream.  I look forward to conducting interdisciplinary research of animal behavior.  From my experience in group art projects, I am confident in my ability in leading scientists from different fields for collaborated research. I am determined to pursue a Ph.~D.~degree to prepare myself with the necessary knowledge and academic connections. Thus I hope to conduct my graduate studies in the University of California, Berkeley.\\

%Another branch of my early developed interests is craft arts. I have earned awards in numerous craft competitions before entering the college. Now this talent assists me greatly in academic and extracurricular performances. The patience and carefulness trained from making complicated crafts contribute in accomplishing tasks, especially in lab works. Additionally, I have led group artworks in numerous activities, such as department exhibition in the Azalea Festival, chemistry camp for high school, and dramas. 
%Leading group artworks is different from doing individual ones. It needs skills to integrate various styles and encourage people to bring new ideas. I learned how to give concrete and simple orders to help team members to accomplish the target. Moreover, I realized that great works are from a team with great diversity. And I am confident in leading such a team to success.  \\

%Besides chemistry, I am also passionate in animals. Their amazing behaviors are the most representing masterpieces of nature. I have been a volunteer in the Taipei Zoological Foundation for a few months. Besides designing games that educate children about animal conservation, I joined their academic discussions. I found ecological explanations to the animal behaviors couldn't satisfy me. For example, I want to know what decides the 17 and 13 year life cycles of periodical cicadas, but rather than simply accept that the two coprime numbers are a result from the purpose of avoiding each other's breeding year. The answers to these questions lie in a microscopic rather than a macroscopic scale. With my chemistry background, I believe I can make unique contributions in animal behavior studies.\\

%I have been fascinated by the delicate designs in biological systems, thus leading a career that discloses the mysteries in nature will fulfill my life. With this enthusiasm, I resolved to conduct the interdisciplinary research of animal behaviors from chemistry and physics approaches. According to my experiences in group artworks, I am confident in leading scientists from different fields for collaborated research. In order to achieve my goal, I determined to pursue a Ph.~D.~degree to prepare myself with necessary knowledge and academic connections. Thus I hope to conduct my graduate studies in the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

%After graduation, I keep working on the theoretical study of the EET process as a research assistant in Professor Cheng's lab. Since the simulation method is complete, my work now is focused on the applications to the real systems. One of the target molecules is the silylene spaced copolymer from Professor Tien-Yau Luh's group. The experiments made by Professor I-Chia Chen's group indicate that there are ultrafast energy transfer, which can not be explained with Forster theory, between the subunits of this copolymer. We now cooperate with Professor Chao-Ping Hsu's group. We plan to use the electronic couplings of the copolymers calculated by their DFT method to construct the Hamiltonian for our simulation, and see if we can explain the observation from the experiments.

%    Their amazing behaviors are the most representing masterpieces of nature. I have been a volunteer in the Taipei Zoological Foundation for a few months. Besides joining their zoology and ecology discussions, I designed games that educate children about animal conservation. Although I got a great sense of achievement from teaching, I found conducting the researches in these fields would not fulfill my life. I pursue an in depth understanding of the fundamental reasons that dominant the behaviors, but not the phenomena themselves. The answers to these questions lie in a microscopic rather than a macroscopic scale. In other words, I want to study the reason of animal behaviors from a molecular viewpoint.

%Although I am more confident in hands-on activities, I joined in a Professor Cheng's lab in order to strength my theoretical background and ability in programming, which I believe are important for any research. I met great obstacles when learning quantum dynamics theories and doing numerical simulations due to lack of mathematical knowledge. It took me a lot of efforts and time to follow up. Thus I decided to give myself some more time before turning into a new stage of study.  



%My interests in chemistry became apparent when I was in senior high school. 
%I have been pursuing a career of science for my whole life. I attended in a science and math talented class in senior high school. The courses for this class are designed for training future scientists. At first I was interested in physics. I made a research about the total reflection of water waves with my partner. Our project was presented in scientific exhibitions and won a third place in the national contest. Later I turned toward chemistry. I am fascinated by the concrete concepts suggested by chemists about how changes happen in the nature world. I studied this subject in advance, and represented the school to attend the chemistry competition and won a third class prize. With the passion and confidence in chemistry research, I conducted my undergraduate education in the Chemistry Department of National Taiwan University.  \\

%I will never forget how excited I was when I first learned the evolution of birds form dinosaurs, the Fibonacci series in the biological patterns, the total reflection shown by a green laser in the water flow..., all these experiences deeply impressed me with the wonder of nature world.
%This is why I seek to the road of becoming a scientist. I want to disclose the mysteries of nature phenomena. With this goal in mind, I put efforts to scientific studies in my following learning stages. Thus, achieving a Ph.~D.~ degree will be a milestone for me to formally start my research career. \\

%I am specially interested in birds, because they are the most common ``wild animals" in city. I recognize virtually all species of the birds in the campus. I have visited a bird nest almost every day to track the maturing of the chicks until they leave. I took an ornithology course and received the highest grade even I already have enough credits to graduate. I found that to study animal behavior from a molecular viewpoint, that is, the mechanism of nervous systems, can give unique insight. And this inspired my future research direction.
